# Interactive Sorting Algorithm Animation (Java Swing app)
Created for my Software Development Methods class, this app animates selection sort, insertion sort, and bubble sort on a random set of data (generated on launch). The user can modify the speed, pause, and restart as necessary.

The app utilizes a separate thread for each sorting algorithm, each sending data to a GUI class to update the interface simultaneously.
